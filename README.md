# IoT-Intrusion-Detection
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect intrusion in IoT networks using the botnet dataset and the ToN dataset.

The Botnet dataset helps us detect the following classes: DDoS, DoS, Reconnaissance, Normal & Theft.
The Ton dataset helps us detect the following classes: normal, scanning, ransomware, backdoor, ddos, xss, password, injection, dos, & mitm.

The `IoT_ML_with_Bot_Dataset.ipynb` notebook shows the training of several machine learning algorithms with the Botnet dataset.

The `IoT_ML_with_Ton_Dataset.ipynb` notebook shows the training of several machine learning algorithms with the Ton dataset.

The `IoT_ML_with_Hybrid_model.ipynb` shows the training of a Hybrid machine learning with the Ton dataset.

The `IoT_ML_explain_with_LIME_Bot_dataset.ipynb` shows the training of several machine learning algorithms with the Botnet dataset. It also uses explainable AI (LIME) to explain the decisions of the machine learning model.
